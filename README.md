## Migration from auth schema

According to this - https://github.com/Razikus/supabase-nextjs-template/issues/4

We are no longer able to modify auth schema. I modified original migrations to rename it to custom schema. If you need to migrate from older version - check supabase/migrations_for_old/20250525183944_auth_removal.sql
